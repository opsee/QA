# QA Testing and Logging
> This repo is a listing of tests, each of which resides in a subirectory.  Each test's subdirectory should have 
> all of the information necessary to reproduce it along with a test.md file...

## A test.md
> Each test should have at least:
 1.  Pre  (Description of the setup and associated environment)
 2.  Test (Enumeration of the steps of the test and what happened)
 3.  Post (Description of the state of the system vs desired state and why)

### Note
> Feel free to update this test methodology, write desired data, etc and I'll ensure that I use it when I'm testing --dan
